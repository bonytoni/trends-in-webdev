## Part 2

Solve the 4 JavaScript questions in `preassessment.js`.

_[Optional, but highly recommended]_: Test your code. Get a head start on the
course's development environment by installing Node.js
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (the LTS version).

Then, in a terminal with the extracted contents of these pretest files, run
`node preassessment.test.js` to evaluate your `preassessment.js` code. You may
add more test cases if you wish.
